# Medical QA RAG System using LangChain

##  Features
- LangChain-based RAG pipeline
- FAISS vector store
- Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- LLM: Gemini-2.5-flash
- Streamlit interface
- `.uv` compatible setup (no venv needed)

##  Tools Used
- LangChain
- FAISS CPU
- HuggingFace Embeddings and LLM
- Streamlit for UI
- PyMuPDF for PDF parsing
- langchain-google-genai

## AI Assistance
- Used Chatgpt for better understanding of architecture of the project

##  Chunking Strategy
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- chunk size: 500, overlap: 50

##  Workflow
1. `ingest.py`: Loads PDF, chunks it, builds and saves vector DB
2. `query.py`: Loads vector store and LLM to answer any question
3. `app.py`: Streamlit frontend to input question and view answer

##  Instructions
```
uv init
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
python ingest.py
python query.py
streamlit run app.py
```

Put your PDF inside `data/sample_pdf.pdf`.
